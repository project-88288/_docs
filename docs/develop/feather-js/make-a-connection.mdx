# Make a connection

Users can interact with the blockchain by using the following modes:

- Querying data
- Broadcasting a transaction

## Connect to a chain

To perform these actions, connect to the blockchain by using an `LCDClient` object, which represents a connection to a node running the light client daemon (LCD). The LCD serves as a RESTful API over HTTP. feather.js abstracts away the details of making raw API calls and provide an interface with which you can work.

```ts
import { LCDClient } from '@terra-money/feather.js';

const lcd = new LCDClient({
  'pisco-1': {
    lcd: 'https://pisco-lcd.terra.dev',
    chainID: 'pisco-1',
    gasAdjustment: 1.75,
    gasPrices: { uluna: 0.015 },
    prefix: 'terra', // bech32 prefix, used by the LCD to understand which is the right chain to query
  },
});
```
