# Feather.js

Feather.js is a fork of terra.js with interchain capabilities. It can be used to interact with cosmos blockchains like Terra within JavaScript runtimes, such as Node.js and the browser. feather.js enables the following functionalities:

- Deserializing blockchain data into JavaScript objects with native data types and methods.
- Serializing objects back into a blockchain-compatible format.
- Providing access to the Terrad node API (LCD) and other compatible feather chains from a JavaScript-based interface.
- Providing additional utilities, such as hash functions and key-signing algorithms.

<Admonition type='tip' icon='ðŸ’¡' title='Migrating to feather.js from terra.js'>

- New [configuration syntax](./common-examples.mdx#configuring-lcdclient) for LCDClient to support multiple chains.
- Need to [specify the chainID](./common-examples.mdx#sending-native-tokens) when creating or broadcasting a transaction.
- Queries that require an address with automatically detect the chain based on the bech32 prefix. Otherwise, the query require an extra chainID parameter.
- `accAddress` on Key objects now are now functions that require the prefix as parameter.

Note that Ledger users will be able to use their existing account in the Terra Ledger app on all the new chains.
